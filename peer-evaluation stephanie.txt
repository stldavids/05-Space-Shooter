What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?

 Moving the enemies back and forth was different than i expected

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

 I think stephanie did a really good job at using prior projects (like the bullet excercise) and implementing that code into different projects. Seems really efficient and a good understanding of when to use certain code. 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

More comments!

What could have been clearer or better commented?

Probably a lot. One line even says "initializes a penguin enemy" 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

 Not really. After realizing what each part was doing, it is pretty straightforward.

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 yup

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

 Why it was made, number of enemies, etc. 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

Seems like you immediately knew what you wanted to do and you executed it quickly and efficiently. No random code blocks that don't really do anything.
