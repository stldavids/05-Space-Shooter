Project: 05 Space Shooter
Peer's repository: https://github.com/stldavids/05-Space-Shooter



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
    From looking at their code, I learned how to add a background on a 2D game like this.
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
    My space shooter was pretty elementary. My enemies didnt move and I didn't have a background. Next project I will definetly be implementing 
    the code that stephanie used to make enemy sprites move. 
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
    While what stephanie's work was beyond what I was originally capable of, I would say making the damage your character higher would make the game a little more enjoyable.
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
    There weren't many comments in the original code that stephanie created, so maybe if she added notes next to where she added the background or 
    made the sprites move it would be a little easier to understand.
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
    There was nothing inherently confusing, the game runs fine and is perfectly understandable.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
    Yes 
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
    Her README is very brief, and only talked about what the game was. So maybe if she talked about what she learned during the process of creating this game
    it would be more descriptive.
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
    Hey Stephanie, I was really impressed with the quality of your game and neatness of your code. I really hope to make something as good 
    as this in the next project!
